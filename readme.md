# Firebase Frequently Asked Questions

#### :question: I get `permission_denied` warnings in my console when setting up Firebase

Be sure to select "Realtime database" as as your database type inside Firebase. If you created your database as a Cloud Firestore type, you can change it in the Database tab.

#### :question: I can't log in to the store after I deployed to Netlify/Apache

Firebase by default only allows logins from localhost or the Firebase website. You'll need to add your deploy URL to the Authorized Domains in the Sign-in method area of your Firebase console.
